# Assingment 2: Control Structures in Python

## Task 1: Check if a number is even or odd
 This Python script checks whether a given number is even or odd.
- The program prompts the user to enter a number.
- It converts the input to an integer.
- It checks if the number is divisible by 2:
    - If yes, it prints that the number is even.
    - Otherwise, it prints that the number is odd.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
 This Python script calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using loop
 - Initialize the variable:
   - The variable `total` is set to `0`. This will store the running sum.
 - Loop through numbers 1 to 50:
   - The `for` loop goes through each number from 1 to 50.
   - For each number `i` , it adds `i` to `total`.
 - Print the result.
   - After the loop. the script prints the final value of `total`, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.
