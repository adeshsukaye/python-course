## Module 5: File, Exceptions, and Errors in python

## Task 1: Read a file and handle errors 

This Python script reads the contents of a text file and handles errors such as missing files or other exceptions.

1. The script will print each line of the file with its line number. If the file is not found, an error message will be displayed.


## Task 2: Write and Append Data to file

This Python script demonstrates basic file operations: writing, appending, and reading text files with error handling.

1. The script asks the user to enter text, which is written to `output.txt` (overwriting any existing content).
2. It then prompts for additional text to append to the same file.
3. Finally, it reads and prints the entire content of `output.txt`.
